          <p>Attire for the wedding is <i>a la cocktail</i>. Weather permitting, the ceremony will take place outside in the back of the Ingenhuett. The property is grassy and a little uneven, so please keep that in mind when selecting your dancing shoes.</p>
          <p>To allow all guests to relax and enjoy themselves, we ask that the events be adults only.</p>

      <h2>Where to Stay</h2>
      <div class="content">
        <div class="text">
          <p><a href="https://www.meyerinn.com/Accommodations/index.html" target="_blank">The Meyer Inn!</a> This quaint time-capsuled inn is steps away from the heart of Comfort and  conveniently, all festivities for the weekend. We have set aside a block of rooms for you fine folks. To reserve, please <a href="https://resnexus.com/resnexus/reservations/group/B93F3C52-FEDF-42E5-9E72-61DF04A9D120?GID=903da52f-3f6b-4212-b580-c03adbd150f6" target="_blank">go here</a> or call (877) 836-1725. </p>
          <p>Also, the <a href="https://thefrenchcow1922.com/accommodations-french-cow-bb/" target="_blank">French Cow Bed and Breakfast</a> is a three minute saunter from all events and has a variety of accommodations.</p>
          <p>There are a handful of lovely properties on Airbnb/VRBO that can accommodate larger groups and those looking to share celebratory space for the weekend! Our only recommendation would be: <i>stay central</i>. Comfort is tiny and best enjoyed on foot. </p>

      <h2>How to Get Here</h2>
      <div class="content">
        <div class="text">
          <p>If you're flying, San Antonio (SAT) and Austin (ATX) are the nearest airports. ATX is a little larger and may have more direct flights (and <i>Jo's Coffee</i>) but, what SAT is lacking in flight schedules and amenities, it makes up for in proximity. Choose your own adventure!</p>
          <h3>From San Antonio</h3><i>Around 45 minutes travel time.</i>
          <p>Follow I-10 West; Take exit 524 (Comfort exit). Proceed straight ahead from the exit and stay to the left when the road forks. Take a left on 8th Street, then the first right onto High Street. <i>Voila!</i></p>
          <h3>From Austin</h3><i>Around 1 hour 45 minutes travel time.</i>
          <p>Leave the city on Highway 290 West. In Henly, take a left onto Highway 165 West. In Blanco, take a left onto Highway 281 South. Take a right onto Highway 473 West and follow that road into Comfort. Once in Comfort, take a left onto 6th Street (which is the first left after crossing over Business Rd 87). Follow 6th Street for two blocks and take a left onto High Street. <i>Voila!</i></p>
