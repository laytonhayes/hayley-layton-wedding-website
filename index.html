      <h2>About Comfort, Texas</h2>
      <div class="content">
        <div class="text">
          <p>A Hill Country gem operating at a different speed. Founded by German freethinkers in the 1850s, Comfort remains an independent, unincorporated community to this day. The town draws treasure hunters, entrepreneurs, and a unique mix of residents seeking a slower pace in Texas's famed Hill Country. River floats, wine-tasting, antiques, and wildlife all within reach. We're excited to share this treasured town with y'all! See below for a few of our favorite spots.</p>

      <h2>Where to Stay</h2>
      <div class="content">
        <div class="text">
          <p><a href="https://www.meyerinn.com/Accommodations/index.html" target="_blank">The Meyer Inn!</a> This quaint time-capsuled inn is steps away from the heart of Comfort--and, conveniently, all festivities for the weekend. We have set aside a block of rooms for you fine folks--creekside, poolside, and founder's quarters. For more information, please visit their <a href="https://www.meyerinn.com/Accommodations/index.html" target="_blank">website</a> and call to book: (877) 836-1725. (technology adoption is a little slower in Comfort)</p>
          <p>There are also a handful of lovely properties on Airbnb/VRBO that can accommodate larger groups and those looking to share celebratory space for the weekend! Our only recommendation would be--stay central. Comfort is tiny and best enjoyed on foot. </p>

      <h2>How to Get Here</h2>
      <div class="content">
        <div class="text">
          <p>If you're flying San Antonio (SAT) and Austin (ATX) are the nearest airports. ATX is a little larger and may have more direct flights (and Jo&apos;s Coffee) but, what SAT is lacking in flight schedules and amenities, it makes up for in proximity. Choose your own adventure!</p>
          <h3>From San Antonio</h3><i>Around 45 minutes travel time.</i>
          <p>Follow I-10 West; Take exit 524 (Comfort exit). Proceed straight ahead from the exit and stay to the left when the road forks. Take a left on 8th St, then the first right onto High St. </p>
          <h3>From Austin</h3><i>Around 1 hour 45 minutes travel time.</i>
          <p>Leave the city on Highway 290 West. In Henly, take a left onto Highway  165 West. In Blanco, take a left onto Highway 281 South. Take a right onto Highway 473 West and follow that road into Comfort. Once in Comfort, take a left onto 6th St (which is the first left after crossing over Business Rd 87). Follow 6th St. for two blocks and take a left onto High St. </p>
