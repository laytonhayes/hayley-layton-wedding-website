        h2 About Comfort, Texas
        p A Hill Country gem operating at a different speed. Founded by German freethinkers in the 1850s, Comfort remains an independent, unincorporated community to this day. The town draws treasure hunters, entrepreneurs, and a wide range of residents seeking a slower pace in Texasâ€™ famed Hill Country. River floats, wine-tasting, antiques, and wildlife all within reach.
