            p #[a(href='https://www.meyerinn.com/Accommodations/index.html' target='_blank') The Meyer Inn!] This quaint time-capsuled inn is steps away from the heart of Comfort and, conveniently, all festivities for the weekend. We have set aside a block of rooms for you fine folks. To reserve, please #[a(href='https://resnexus.com/resnexus/reservations/group/B93F3C52-FEDF-42E5-9E72-61DF04A9D120?GID=903da52f-3f6b-4212-b580-c03adbd150f6' target='_blank') go here] or call (877) 836-1725. 
            p Also, the #[a(href='https://thefrenchcow1922.com/accommodations-french-cow-bb/' target='_blank') French Cow Bed and Breakfast] is a three minute saunter from all events and has a variety of accommodations.
            p There are a handful of lovely properties on Airbnb/VRBO that can accommodate larger groups and those looking to share celebratory space for the weekend! Our only recommendation would be: #[i stay central]. Comfort is tiny and best enjoyed on foot.

            p If you're flying, San Antonio (SAT) and Austin (ATX) are the nearest airports. ATX is a little larger and may have more direct flights (and Jo&apos;s Coffee) but, what SAT is lacking in flight schedules and amenities, it makes up for in proximity. Choose your own adventure!
            h3 From San Antonio
            i Around 45 minutes travel time.
            p Follow I-10 West; Take exit 524 (Comfort exit). Proceed straight ahead from the exit and stay to the left when the road forks. Take a left on 8th St, then the first right onto High St. 

            h3 From Austin
            i Around 1 hour 45 minutes travel time.
            p Leave the city on Highway 290 West. In Henly, take a left onto Highway  165 West. In Blanco, take a left onto Highway 281 South. Take a right onto Highway 473 West and follow that road into Comfort. Once in Comfort, take a left onto 6th St (which is the first left after crossing over Business Rd 87). Follow 6th St. for two blocks and take a left onto High St.

            p Attire for the wedding is fun semi-formal. Weather permitting, the ceremony will take place outside in the back of the Ingenhuett. The property is grassy and a little uneven, so you may want to keep that in mind when selecting shoes. We want everyone to feel festive in whatever theyâ€™re comfortable in.
            p To allow all guests to relax and enjoy themselves, we ask that the events be adults only.
            p Your presence is present enough, seriously! But, if you insist, we are registered through #[a(href='https://www.zola.com/registry/hayleyandlayton/edit' target='_blank') Zola].
